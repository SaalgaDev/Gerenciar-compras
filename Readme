This program allows you to manage purchases in a simple way. The user can register a new purchase, where they enter the name of the purchase, quantity of products and values, which are saved in a text file. It is also possible to search for a specific purchase and list all saved purchases. Each purchase is recorded in individual files with a .txt extension in the current directory, making it easier to manage and consult the purchase history.
